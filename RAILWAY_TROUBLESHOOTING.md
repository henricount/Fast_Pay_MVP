# 🔧 Railway Deployment Troubleshooting

## Common Network Process Failures & Solutions

### ✅ **Fixed Issues in This Update:**

1. **Port Configuration**: Added proper `$PORT` environment variable handling
2. **Health Check**: Changed from `/api/v1/analytics/dashboard` to simpler `/health` endpoint  
3. **Timeout Issues**: Increased timeout from 100s to 300s
4. **Startup Command**: Changed to `python -m uvicorn` for better compatibility
5. **Database Initialization**: Added error handling for Railway's filesystem

### 🚀 **Deploy Options:**

#### **Option 1: Try Railway Again (Recommended)**
1. Push the updated files to GitHub
2. In Railway, disconnect and reconnect your repo
3. Redeploy - should work now with fixes

#### **Option 2: Use Render (More Reliable)**
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com) 
2. "New Web Service"
3. Connect GitHub repo
4. It will auto-detect `render.yaml`
5. Deploy (usually more reliable than Railway)

#### **Option 3: Use Vercel (Serverless)**
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. "Import Project" 
3. Connect GitHub repo
4. Deploy instantly

### 🐛 **If Railway Still Fails:**

Check these in Railway dashboard:

1. **Build Logs**: Look for Python/pip installation errors
2. **Deploy Logs**: Check for port binding issues  
3. **Environment Variables**: Ensure `PORT` is set automatically
4. **Memory Usage**: Free tier has 512MB limit

### 🔄 **Alternative Railway Commands:**

If the main config fails, try these manual commands in Railway:

```bash
# Build Command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start Command:
python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT

# Or use the script:
./railway-start.sh
```

### 🆘 **Emergency Backup - Manual Deployment:**

1. Use **Replit**: Import from GitHub, runs instantly
2. Use **CodeSandbox**: Import GitHub repo, auto-deploys
3. Use **Glitch**: Import from GitHub, free hosting

### 📊 **Health Check:**

Your app now has a simple health endpoint at `/health` that returns:
```json
{"status": "healthy", "service": "Fast Pay MVP"}
```

This should resolve most Railway network process failures!
